  <h1 id="mytag">WELCOME TO FINAL FRONTIER</h1>
  <p>The way i see it FINAL FRONTIER is not some distant made up fantasy destinaiton for the people tired from the world and all of its delight and are looking for a way out
  from the realities of this world....NO! hell No! ,the place or you can call it a destination is quite real . I am writing this artice because I want you (whoever is reading this!) to find that 
  destination for yourselves and find what it means to you. Because untill and unless you would do that you won`t be free , So what is final frontier? The way i see it final frontier is a place for a person where he can be free with
  who and what he is- it could be a garage shop(yeah you bet!) or it could be a small place in your creative little head,a nature`s getaway or it could be a black and white binary world where many find that solitary confinment which help them to be a little closer to themelves(there trueselves) rather than to again
  pretend who it is they are going to be the very next moment infront of every other indivual.My reason for writing this article,is it to make you realized or atleast think that life is more than your job,your jobtitle or that fancy little car you drove around or all the materalistic possesions of life
  that you happily accept in this spiderweb. Now the big question is how to find that FINAL FRONTIER and where does it exsists? Well learning from all the past great seekers ,philosphers and visionaries I can tell one thing for sure that untill and unless you won`t follow your passion or simply what it is you 
  crave for and what it is that makes you happy and full that place will be a long and distant memory for you and you be forever condemend to the fires of Mount Doom: ...just kidding! 
  But anyways the point is no matter the limitations, no matter the tight schedule you have -you have to go visit your FINAL FRONTIER for you sake only.It doesn`t matter what you do at your job ,what you bank balance looks like or whether you drive ferrrari or a 800 you have to find FINAL FRONTIER! Because the true happiness to life
  is doing what you love ..right. We know life hardly turns out the way we want it to be nd seldom do we get to do what is it we want but in those minute possibilities lies all the hidden joys of life and you have to make time for it and if you are already doing that what you love ,kudos  to you(leave a thumbs up comment ;-)) but not everyone is 
  that blessed  but you have to make time and do what soothes you soul and mind rather than than your eyes and body.
  Now the million dollar question - How to find my passion? Well easier said than done my friend.
  Everyone tell you to find your passion keep looking for it, don`t settle but in which direction ,from where to start.Well everyone has there own glory time trail and according to one of my friend it doesn`t mean you have lost if you took more time in reaching your state and don`t confuse it with the materailstic possesions you have but rather 
  a point in your life where you are happy and content in the journey but yearns for that final frontier that will set you free and thrives to learn and live a lot more.
  The point is you have to try evrything you like,likes and liked ... that is the best and most fruitfull way i guess ,just don`t settle .You have to be content in the journey not with the destination ,you need to start enjoying all the little joys of your life which you have long forgotten but forever working in the direction to find your FINAL FRONTIER and trust me
  "It is really about the jouney not the destination .So start doing everything you liked it can be the most weird thing or the most fruitfull but you will really be pleased with doing it ,do something that gives you a sense of purpose , no matter whatever it is and that makes your soul happy from inside.It took me quite a few stumbles here and there to realize this one simple fact,
 untill a wise man once said to me -"college is not about your grades,it is not about your realtionships and grudes but about finding your passion and working towards it ,the moment you do" .College seems appropriate cause your`e free ,have ample time and full of energy and independence but it doesn`t mean that if you missed your chance in college 
 you`re out of the game ...hell no!! The whole life is a process of learning and throught your`e life you have to keep looking for it no matter what just don`t settle . Learn as much as you can in your life and about anything which makes tickles your curiosity, don`t confine to the studies for the materalistic world but also try to have a deeper sense of life in everything you do.
 Sounds a bit spiritual right .Good you need it to. 
 Submission to a higher power,one that guides you and feels connected to you everywhere and in everything you do in a form or formless manner (upto you), is a way of having a deeper sense to life and to do everything that  we do with integrity,morality 
 and in service of the society. Help with ego problems also ;-) .The thing is as yoda says "The true great warrior is one who understands the balance of the FORCE both the "light" and the dark "side" of it".Hence both the materialistic as well as the real world.
 So the conclusion of this brief article can be described with few lines- 
 "Do what you love,Love what you do and most importantly enjoy the Journey".
