		<p>
	    This site is a partial collection of projects I've worked on, thoughts I've written down, 
	    and softwares I create and posted.
	  	</p>
	    	<p>
	    In the past I have worked as hardware engineer, marketing guy, programmer and designer. I have worked for
	    PCB manufacturing startups and have written simple programs and DIY projects to help the community. I like exploring.
	    I used to do a lot of backpacking trips across the country in college with my friends, some of which went terribly wrong also. 
	    I travel as far as I could go on and continue to do so hopefully! I currently live in Bangalore.
	  	</p>
		 <p>
	    I like computer security and software development, particularly in the areas of secure communication, 
	    cryptography, hacking, and anonymity. I also enjoy my fare share of hardware hacking as I am learning it gradually.
	    But to tell you the truth, in  words of my college days hero - Moxie Marlinspike  <em>Cypherpunks<em> :
	    "I also secretly hate technology, am partially horrified with the direction the so called "geek" culture has gone, 
	    and have little affection for the weird entrepreneur scene that's currently devouring the country."
		 </p>
		 <p>
	    I like to travel some of the beautiful countries of the world  and would like to have my own simple 
	    beach-side shack (resturant) in the future to get away from the world sometimes. I write small articles on my blog
	    related to computers, security and technology, travelling, and different events from my life.
		 </p>
		 <p>
	   In general I would like to contribute to a world where skills, imagination and relationships are valued over careers
	   and money, where we know better to trust banks, cops and politicians, where we can share our thoughts freely, and 
	   to build a self-sustaining, trustworthy community in a self-motivated as well as in a self-guided way.
